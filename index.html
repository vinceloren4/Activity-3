    <h1>Why I Chose BSIT</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I chose BSIT because ever since I was in high school, I was inspired by watching my cousin do coding and programming.
      That’s why I wanted to take an I.T. course when I entered college.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, after graduating from junior high school and moving into senior high school, my mind changed—I started wanting to pursue nursing instead. 
      But when I graduated from senior high school, my mom couldn’t afford to send me to a nursing course.
      That’s why I went back to my original plan and chose the I.T. course.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you ask me whether I regret taking BSIT, my answer is no because I.T. was actually my first choice from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason I chose BSIT is because of the opportunities it offers. 
      We live in a digital age where technology plays a vital role in almost every industry. 
      From healthcare and business to education and entertainment, IT professionals are in demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, I chose BSIT because I enjoy learning how to solve problems. Programming challenges me to think critically and creatively. 
      It’s not always easy, but the satisfaction I get from making a program work or fixing an error motivates me to keep learning and improving.
